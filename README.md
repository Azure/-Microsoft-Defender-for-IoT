## Introduction
These labs help you get ramped up with Microsoft Defender for IoT and provide hands-on practical experience for product features, capabilities, and scenarios.

The lab deploys a Microsoft Defender for IoT Sensor and provides data (PCAPs) to simulate scenarios that showcase various Microsoft Defender for IoT features. You should expect very little or no cost at all due to the fact that Microsoft Defender for IoT offers a 30-day free trial, so the only cost are of the Azure subscription resources. 

## Prerequisites
To deploy Microsoft Defender for IoT Trainig Lab, **you must have a Microsoft Azure subscription**. If you do not have an existing Azure subscription, you can sign up for a free trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
